# Dockerized WordPress for Development

This is a WordPress [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container setup for local development. This setup was put together based on the [WordPress Developer's Intro To Docker](https://codeable.io/wordpress-developers-intro-to-docker-part-two/) series at [codeable](https://codeable.io). This project was developed as a way to learn Docker in general and, specifically, how I can incorporate it into my [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) development workflow.

## Features

* Local `wp-content` folder
* Local `mysql` folder
* Local `redis` folder
